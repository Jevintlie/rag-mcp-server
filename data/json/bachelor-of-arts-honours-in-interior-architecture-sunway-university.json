Spanning a period of 3 and 1/2 years, you will engage in various aspects of design for interior environments and develop skills which enable you to contribute to the profession with creativity and confidence. The programme of study takes place in a broad range of learning environments, beginning with studio experience which engages you in the fundamentals of design process and thinking, allowing knowledge and skill-development in the practice of designing interactions between people and interior spaces. You will be exposed to a balanced mixture of theoretical and practical subjects such as design practice, modelling, drawing, furniture design, and sustainable design. A keen sense of design coupled with communication skills and the ability to utilise the latest technology, will equip you for a career in any field of design.
