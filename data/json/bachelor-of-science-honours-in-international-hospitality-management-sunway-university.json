In Year 1, students explore core disciplines such as Culinary Operations, Foodservice, and Hotel Accommodation. Year 2 deepens their industry knowledge through key modules like Revenue Management and F&B Management, as well as a 10-week internship. Students may then specialise in one of three career-driven streams: Luxury & Prestige, Immersive Event Design, or AI & Digital Solutions, focusing respectively on luxury brand services, experiential events, or digital hospitality transformation. In Year 3, students complete courses in Strategic Management and finish with a capstone Research Project. Graduates emerge as Hotel Managers, Business Development Executives, or Service Quality Managers, with expanded roles in Luxury Hotel Branding, Corporate Events, or Digital Hospitality Marketing based on their chosen specialisation.
